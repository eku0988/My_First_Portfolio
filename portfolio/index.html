    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;  I am a recent Electrical and Computer Engineering graduate from Hawassa University, awarded Great Distinction with a CGPA of 3.75/4.0, and recognized for consistent academic excellence. My passion lies in software engineering, especially backend development, problem-solving, and building impactful digital solutions.<br/>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; I’ve been honored with the Binder of Honor for Academic Excellence, awarded by the College of Engineering for ranking in the top 1% of students. In the 2021/22 academic year, I was also ranked #1 among all female students in the Electrical Faculty and received recognition including certificates, a watch, and a book for outstanding performance.
        <br/>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; Currently, I’m advancing my skills through two highly regarded programs: A2SV (Africa to Silicon Valley) and ALX Software Engineering, where I work on real-world software development and algorithmic challenges in collaborative environments.
        <br/>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; I’m continuously improving in areas like data structures, algorithms, version control (Git), and collaborative development. I combine my engineering foundation with a strong drive to learn, adapt, and solve meaningful problems through technology. I am also trained in peacebuilding and communication, having completed 40+ hours of Peace Education Training delivered by Hawassa University in collaboration with the British Council and the European Union.I am actively seeking entry-level roles or internships in electrical and computer engineering, where I can contribute my technical skills, grow continuously, and collaborate on impactful projects.</p>
